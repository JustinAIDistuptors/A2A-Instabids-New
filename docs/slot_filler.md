# Slot Filler Implementation

## Overview

The slot filler module provides structured data collection capabilities for the InstaBids agent system. It manages conversation state to gather all required information from users in a systematic way, tracking which data points (slots) have been collected and which are still needed.

## Key Components

### 1. Slot Definitions

Slots are defined in `src/instabids/agents/slot_filler.py` as a dictionary with questions and validation options:

```python
SLOTS = {
    "category": {
        "q": "What category best fits this project (repair, renovation, installation, maintenance, construction, other)?",
        "options": ["repair", "renovation", "installation", "maintenance", "construction", "other"]
    },
    "job_type": {
        "q": "Which specific job is it? (e.g. roof repair, lawn mowing)"
    },
    # ... more slots defined
}
```

Each slot can optionally define:
- A question prompt to ask the user
- A list of valid options (for slots with enumerated options)

### 2. Core Functions

- `missing_slots(card)`: Returns a list of which slots still need to be filled, in priority order
- `validate_slot(slot_name, value)`: Validates a value against slot constraints
- `get_next_question(card)`: Returns the question to ask for the next slot that needs filling

### 3. Integration with Conversation State

The `ConversationState` class in `memory/conversation_state.py` provides:
- State tracking for ongoing conversations
- Methods to add user input and extract structured data
- Persistence between turns

## Usage

The slot filler is primarily used in the `HomeownerAgent` class:

```python
# Process input and determine if more information is needed
missing = missing_slots(bid_card)
if missing:
    next_question = get_next_question(bid_card)
    return {
        "need_more": True, 
        "follow_up": next_question,
        # ... other response fields
    }
```

## Enhancing the Job Classifier

Along with the slot filler, the job classifier has been improved:

1. **More Detailed Categories**: Using Literal types to enforce valid job categories
2. **Vision Integration**: Ability to use image tags to enhance classification
3. **Confidence Scores**: Each classification includes a confidence score
4. **Improved Text Matching**: Uses word boundary matching for more accurate keyword detection

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests:

- Testing slot definitions and validation
- Testing missing slot detection
- Testing question generation logic
- Testing classification with different input texts and vision tags

## Future Improvements

- NLP-based slot extraction (currently uses simple rule-based extraction)
- More sophisticated validation rules
- Support for dependent slots
- ML-based job classification (currently rule-based)
