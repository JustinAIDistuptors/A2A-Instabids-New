## Integration Issues

We have identified and fixed several issues with the test infrastructure:

### 1. Google ADK Version Mismatch

- **Issue**: The tests were written for an older version of Google ADK that included `LlmAgent` and `enable_tracing`, but the current installed version (0.4.0) doesn't have these components.
- **Resolution**: Created modified tests that use the current Google ADK `Agent` class and properly configured it with the API key.

### 2. Unicode Character Display

- **Issue**: Tests using Unicode characters (‚úÖ, ‚ùå) failed on Windows with charmap codec errors.
- **Resolution**: Replaced Unicode characters with plain text alternatives like [PASS] and [FAIL].

### 3. Async Test Execution

- **Issue**: Some tests using async functions required special handling to run.
- **Resolution**: Modified the runner to use proper asyncio handling for these tests. Added `@pytest.mark.asyncio` marker to async test functions.

### 4. Google API Key Integration

- **Issue**: The current Google ADK (0.4.0) requires an API key to run LLM-based tests, which wasn't properly configured.
- **Resolution**: Created tests that properly configure the API key using environment variables.

### 5. Security Concerns with Hardcoded Credentials

- **Issue**: API keys and service role tokens were hardcoded in test files, preventing safe GitHub pushes.
- **Resolution**: Modified the code to use environment variables for all sensitive credentials.

## Implementation Notes

### Memory System

The memory system test confirms that:

1. The memory system uses two tables:
   - `user_memories` - Stores the main memory data as JSONB with context, learned preferences, and interactions
   - `user_memory_interactions` - Stores individual interactions separately for easier querying

2. Memory data structure:
   ```json
   {
     "context": {
       "favorite_color": "blue",
       "favorite_room": "kitchen"
     },
     "interactions": [
       {
         "type": "login",
         "timestamp": "2025-05-06T00:24:01.247113",
         "data": { "device": "mobile", "location": "home" }
       }
     ],
     "learned_preferences": {},
     "creation_date": "2025-05-06T00:24:00.020416"
   }
   ```

3. Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
   - The `user_memories` table has RLS enabled with a policy requiring auth.uid() to match user_id
   - This means direct SQL manipulation requires admin/service role access

### API Access Notes

1. Direct API mode works for database manipulation using the Python Supabase client:
   ```python
   client = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE)
   result = client.table("table_name").insert(data).execute()
   ```

2. `execute_sql` in the MCP tools appears to be limited to read-only operations by design.

### End-to-End Flow

The end-to-end test confirms that the entire workflow works as expected:

1. User creation or retrieval
2. Memory system initialization
3. Project creation
4. Storage system integration
5. Project photo management
6. Bid card creation
7. Memory interaction tracking

All these components are correctly integrated and working together with the real Supabase database.

### Google ADK Integration

Our investigation into the current Google ADK (v0.4.0) has revealed significant changes from the version the tests were originally written for:

1. The current ADK has an `Agent` class instead of `LlmAgent`
2. The current ADK uses a different approach for streaming and tracing
3. The current ADK requires properly configured API keys (both Google and Anthropic)
4. The current structure supports:
   - Base `Agent` class
   - `Runner` class for executing agents
   - `InMemorySessionService` for session management
   - Different handling of events and responses

5. Integration patterns:
   ```python
   # Agent creation
   agent = Agent(
       name="homeowner_agent",
       model="gemini-1.5-pro",
       description="Agent that helps homeowners create and manage projects",
       instruction="detailed_instruction",
       tools=[supabase_tool, extract_details_tool]
   )
   
   # Session setup
   session_service = InMemorySessionService()
   session = session_service.create_session(
       app_name="test_app", 
       user_id="user_id", 
       session_id="session_id"
   )
   
   # Runner initialization
   runner = Runner(
       agent=agent,
       app_name="test_app",
       session_service=session_service
   )
   
   # Call pattern
   async for event in runner.run_async(
       user_id="user_id", 
       session_id="session_id", 
       new_message=content
   ):
       if event.is_final_response():
           final_response = event.content.parts[0].text
   ```

## Test Implementation Strategy

For running tests with real services and APIs:

1. Use the Supabase Python client directly to interact with the database:
   ```python
   client = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE)
   ```

2. Always use the service role key for admin-level access to bypass RLS policies:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE", "")
   ```

3. Create unique test data with timestamps to avoid conflicts:
   ```python
   TEST_PREFIX = f"test-{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}"
   ```

4. Always clean up test data after tests:
   ```python
   # Use pytest fixtures with cleanup in the yield section
   @pytest.fixture
   def test_user(supabase_admin_client):
       # Create user
       yield user
       # Clean up
       supabase_admin_client.table("users").delete().eq("id", user["id"]).execute()
   ```

5. Add proper verification to ensure entities were created correctly:
   ```python
   # Verify memory has LLM interactions
   memory_result = supabase_admin_client.table("user_memories").select("memory_data").eq("user_id", user_id).execute()
   assert memory_result.data is not None
   assert len(memory_result.data) == 1
   ```

6. For LLM-dependent tests, ensure API keys are properly configured in environment variables:
   ```python
   os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Set in environment, not in code
   ```

7. For async tests, use the appropriate pytest marker:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_function():
       # Async test code
   ```

pip install pytest-asyncio

# Run a specific LLM test
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_homeowner_with_real_llm.py -v

# Run all integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration -v

# Run tests with output capture disabled
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_homeowner_with_real_llm.py -v -s

# Run the multi-agent interaction test
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_multi_agent_interaction.py -v
```

## Testing Environment Requirements

The following environment variables must be set to run the tests:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

## GitHub Testing Support

   Navigate to the `tests/integration` directory to inspect all the implemented tests

2. **Check commit history**:
   Use `list_commits` to see recent commits with test implementation progress

3. **Create and validate pull requests**:
   Open PRs with specific test changes for review
   Use the GitHub tools to verify test status and CI/CD integration

4. **Run tests in GitHub Actions**:
   Configure GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on push or PR
   Use secrets management to handle API keys securely
