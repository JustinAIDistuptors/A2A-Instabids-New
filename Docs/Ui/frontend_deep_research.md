Build Plan and Best Practices for InstaBids Frontend
Technology Stack and Framework Choice
InstaBids’ frontend should be built on a modern, robust stack that supports real-time interactivity and AI-driven features. The recommended foundation is Next.js 13 (React) for its hybrid rendering capabilities and strong integration with Vercel’s platform
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Next.js provides Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) out of the box, which can improve performance and SEO for public pages, while its API Routes or new App Router allow building backend-for-frontend APIs if needed
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Using TypeScript is advised for type-safety across the codebase, especially when dealing with complex data (like agent messages or bid objects). For the UI layer, leverage Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling. Shadcn UI is a collection of copy-and-paste React components (built on headless Radix UI primitives) that you add directly to your project
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This approach gives you full code ownership of components – you can customize behavior and design without being locked into a library’s black-box implementations
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Radix UI ensures these components are accessible and unstyled, allowing Tailwind CSS to drive the aesthetics
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Tailwind’s utility-first classes will keep the styling consistent and maintainable across the app
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This combo (Shadcn + Tailwind) has the benefit of full control over UI components (no overriding of proprietary styles) and a modern, clean default styleguide
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. In addition, include the Vercel AI SDK on the frontend for seamlessly integrating AI features. The Vercel AI SDK provides React hooks and utilities for conversational UIs and streaming text completions
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. In particular, its useChat hook can be used to interact with InstaBids’ AI agents in real-time, displaying agent responses token-by-token (streaming) as they are generated
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Vercel provides an example template of Next.js + FastAPI with streaming chat using this SDK
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, which can serve as a reference implementation. This helps handle the unique UX of AI content generation (like partial responses and “thinking” indicators) without reinventing the wheel. For client-side state management and data fetching, Next.js’ built-in data fetching (using React Server Components or hooks like useSWR) can cover most needs. However, since the backend uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and possibly authentication, the frontend should initialize a Supabase JavaScript client to leverage Supabase’s real-time data and Auth. The Supabase client will allow direct querying of the database (e.g., to fetch a list of bids or messages) and subscribing to changes, thanks to Supabase’s real-time subscriptions on database tables. For example, you can listen to insert events on a bids table to update the UI when a new bid arrives. Supabase also provides features like Row-Level Security and Role-Based Access Control to help enforce multi-tenant data separation (each user only sees their data)

. This integration means the frontend can use Supabase for user management and live updates, while still calling the FastAPI endpoints for invoking agent actions or complex queries. Summary of Stack: Next.js + TypeScript for the application framework; Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI) for a highly customizable and accessible component library
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
; Supabase JS SDK for database and authentication integration; and Vercel AI SDK for streaming AI interactions. This stack is well-suited to InstaBids’ needs, providing a balance of developer productivity, real-time capabilities, and fine-grained control over the UI.
Authentication and Multi-Role Access Control
InstaBids will serve multiple user types – homeowners, contractors (including labor-only contractors), property managers, and admins – each with different permissions and UIs. A robust authentication and role-based authorization system is critical. It’s recommended to use Supabase Auth for managing user sign-ups, logins, and JWT issuance, as it integrates with the Supabase database out-of-the-box. Supabase supports email/password, OAuth, and magic link authentication methods, which can be easily wired up to a Next.js app using Supabase’s helpers or the Next.js App Router utilities
supabase.com
. Upon login, the frontend should determine the user’s role. This can be done by including a custom claim in the JWT or by storing the role in a profiles table linked to the user. For example, during user registration you might assign a role field ("homeowner", "contractor", etc.), and enforce via Supabase Row-Level Security that users can only access rows that belong to their role or user ID. The Next.js app can parse the Supabase JWT (which is accessible client-side or via server-side session) to identify the role of the user
supabase.com
. Route handling: Using Next.js 13 App Router, create separate groupings of pages (or layouts) for each role. For instance, you might have an /app/homeowner/... set of pages for homeowner-specific interface, /app/contractor/... for contractors, etc. Upon login, you can redirect the user to the appropriate section based on their role. Protect these routes by using Next.js Middleware or server-side checks – e.g., a middleware can read the Supabase auth cookie and redirect if the user isn’t allowed. Also ensure on the client side that UI elements not relevant to a role are not rendered at all (for security and clarity). Admin access: The admin interface could be a separate Next.js route group (e.g. /app/admin) that exposes management features (overview of all projects, user management, etc.). Admin pages should check the user’s role and refuse access if not admin. Supabase’s policy and role system can enforce this at the data level too (e.g., only admin role can read the entire projects table). For authentication flow UI, use Supabase’s pre-built components or build custom forms using Shadcn UI form components. After a successful login, the Supabase client provides a session with a JWT token which will be needed to authorize API calls to the FastAPI backend (e.g., attaching the token in an Authorization header for protected endpoints). The FastAPI backend should validate this token or use Supabase’s verification to ensure the request is authenticated
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This token mechanism allows the frontend to call backend endpoints on behalf of the user securely. In summary, multi-role auth will involve: a unified sign-in/up mechanism via Supabase, a way to identify user role post-login (JWT claims or DB lookup), conditional routing to role-specific pages, and enforcement of permissions both in the UI (showing/hiding features) and on the backend (via token auth and DB security policies). By leveraging Supabase’s built-in Auth and policy features, you ensure a secure separation of data and functionality for each user type with minimal boilerplate.
Real-Time UI Components (Agent Status, Messaging, and Bids)
One of the key challenges is designing UI components that reflect the real-time, asynchronous nature of AI agent interactions. Unlike traditional apps, the AI agents in InstaBids will have a “thinking” process and may produce incremental outputs (streams of text or updates). The frontend should make these processes visible and intuitive to the user, so they feel the system is responsive and trustworthy. Agent “Thinking” State: When an agent is processing a request or working autonomously on a task, the UI should indicate this status clearly. Simple loaders or spinners are a start, but a more informative approach is to show the specific state of the task. The Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol defines a lifecycle for agent tasks – e.g. Submitted, Working, Input-Required, Completed, Failed
linkedin.com
. InstaBids can mirror these states in the UI. For example, if a homeowner’s agent is currently matching contractors, display a status like “Matching in progress…” with perhaps a small animated indicator. If the agent needs user input to proceed (equivalent to an input-required state), surface a prompt in the UI (e.g. “Your AI assistant needs additional details to continue”). By mapping internal agent states to UI indicators, users get a narrative of what’s happening rather than a blank wait. This idea aligns with A2A’s structured task tracking, which provides clarity in monitoring progress
linkedin.com
. Messaging Interface: InstaBids will likely involve conversational interactions – for example, a homeowner chatting with their AI agent to refine a project description, or a contractor agent notifying the user of new bids. Implement a chat component using the Vercel AI SDK’s streaming support. With useChat, you can manage a message list where user messages and agent responses appear as chat bubbles. As the agent responds, stream tokens and update the message gradually (so the user sees the message “typing out” in real time)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This real-time feedback is crucial for good UX in AI systems
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 – it reassures the user that the agent is working on their query and provides partial information without waiting for the full completion. Use Shadcn UI components like ScrollArea for the chat history container (to handle overflow), and maybe a Textarea or Input for the user’s message input. The messaging system should also handle different types of messages: not only free-text chat, but possibly system messages (status updates) styled differently. For example, if the MatchingAgent finds 5 contractors, the UI might inject a system message like “🤖 Match found: 5 potential contractors. Awaiting their bids…”. Bid Submission and Updates: Core to InstaBids is the process of submitting and receiving bids. The frontend should provide a clear interface for this. For homeowners: a form (or conversational prompt) to submit a new project request to their agent. This could be a multi-step form asking for details like project type, budget, timeline, etc., or simply a prompt in the chat (“I need a plumber for a leaking sink”). For contractors: an interface to receive project details and submit a bid quote. Use real-time updates to reflect the bidding process. For instance, once a job is posted, the UI can show a list of “Bid Cards” that are initially empty or in a pending state. As contractor agents submit bids, each Bid Card is populated in real-time with the bid details (price, contractor name, etc.). If using Supabase, you could have a bids table and use Supabase’s live subscription to get notified of new rows (bids) for that project, then append a new card to the list. Alternatively, the FastAPI backend could stream bid events over WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to the frontend. Notably, A2A protocol itself supports SSE streaming updates for long-running tasks
linkedin.com
 – which implies the backend might push events like “Bid received from Contractor X” that the frontend can catch and display immediately. Design each Bid Card as a component (possibly using a Shadcn Card and Badge). It should display key info (contractor, price, ETA, etc.) and perhaps an avatar or logo. Color-code or label the card if it’s the user’s own agent’s bid vs. an external one, or use badges for status (e.g., “New”, “Updated”, “Accepted”). In the spirit of responsiveness, the card might show a loading skeleton or spinner while a bid is being formulated. If an agent is streaming the construction of a bid (e.g., writing a detailed proposal), you might even show a placeholder text that fills in gradually (similar to streaming chat). This level of detail keeps users engaged and aware that progress is being made. Concurrent Interactions: The UI should handle multiple ongoing actions. A homeowner might have one agent searching for bids and at the same time be chatting with another agent (or the same agent on a different topic). Using a tabbed interface or multi-panel UI could help – for example, one tab for “Chat” (direct Q&A with the assistant), another for “Bids” (the project workflow). However, to avoid splitting user attention, it may be better to unify these: treat the entire interaction as a conversation where status updates and results (like bids) appear inline or in a highlighted section. For instance, when bids come in, the agent could post a message, “I have received 3 bids so far. Here they are:” and the Bid Cards list is displayed. This conversational presentation aligns with the agentic UI paradigm which often prefers fluid, dialogue-like interactions over switching screens

. In all real-time components, provide feedback for actions. When a user submits a form or message, immediately acknowledge it in the UI (echo the message, show “Agent is thinking…”). Leverage visual cues (loading spinners, progress bars, animated dots etc.) to signify the agent is working. According to general UX principles, users should always have visibility into system status
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. In an AI agent setting, this might mean showing a subtle “🤖💭” icon when the agent is reasoning, or a progress bar if a known-duration process is underway
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. For longer tasks, show intermediate milestones (e.g., “Analyzing requirements…”, “Connecting to contractors…”, “Waiting for responses…”) – effectively a textual progress indicator. By combining these techniques, the frontend will feel dynamic and alive, matching the behind-the-scenes activities of the AI agents. The goal is to never leave the user wondering if the system is doing anything – always reflect the agent’s state in real time, through either conversational updates or UI elements, to maintain transparency and trust.
Persistent Agent Context and Decision Trails
A standout feature of an AI-agent-driven app is the need to expose the agent’s memory and decision process to the user in a digestible way. Unlike a stateless form submission, the InstaBids agents carry context over time – they remember user preferences, past decisions, ongoing tasks, etc. Providing a window into this context will greatly enhance user understanding of the AI’s behavior and allow for course correction if needed. One approach is to implement an Agent Action Log or Timeline. This would be a persistent panel or page that logs significant events and decisions made by the user’s agent. For example, entries in this timeline could include: “📌 Agent created a new project listing for ‘Kitchen Remodel’” (with timestamp), “🤖 MatchingAgent identified 4 suitable contractors”, “🤖 BidCardAgent rejected 1 bid due to high cost”, “✅ Your agent accepted a bid from ABC Contractors”. Each entry should have a short description, timestamp, and possibly an icon indicating its type or which sub-agent handled it. This creates a narrative of the agent’s operation
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, helping the user follow along with the AI’s autonomous workflow. To implement this, design a Timeline component (could use a Shadcn UI Accordion or simply a styled list) where each item can be expanded for more details
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. For example, a timeline entry might expand to show a detailed rationale or the data that was considered at that step. If the agent consulted an external tool or knowledge base (via an MCP integration), the log could note “Fetched market pricing data” as a sub-step. The key is to record events from the backend: the FastAPI backend should emit events or have an endpoint to fetch the agent’s recent actions. This might be achieved by logging events to the database (e.g., a agent_logs table with user_id, agent, action, timestamp, details) whenever the agent does something noteworthy. The frontend can query this periodically or subscribe in real-time if using something like Supabase’s realtime on that table. Displaying context: In addition to actions, the UI can show the agent’s current context. This might include things like “Active project: Kitchen Remodel; Budget: $10k; Preferred start date: June 1” – essentially the key parameters the agent is working with. This could be presented in a sidebar or header in the dashboard. It ensures the user knows what the AI “believes” the current task or goal is. If that context is wrong (say the budget was misunderstood), the user can catch it and correct it via feedback (rather than the agent going off track). Think of this as an agent state summary, akin to seeing the state of a workflow at a glance. For multi-step workflows, consider visualizing the workflow state. A simple version is a stepper or checklist: e.g., Step 1: Project Created ✅; Step 2: Contractors Matched ✅; Step 3: Bids Received (3/5) ⏳; Step 4: Bid Selected ⏳; Step 5: Job Scheduled ⏳. As the process moves forward, these steps get marked or updated. This essentially reflects the internal workflow of the agents (which might involve multiple agents coordinating under the hood) in terms of user-understandable milestones. Sources on workflow visualization suggest using flowcharts or progress diagrams for complex processes
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, but in a UI, a linear step indicator or branching timeline might suffice. For future scalability, if InstaBids introduces more complex multi-agent orchestration, the UI might even show a graph of agent interactions (for instance, a diagram where HomeownerAgent delegates to MatchingAgent, which talks to several ContractorAgents)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. However, initially it’s probably better to keep it simple and only expose the high-level timeline of what happened rather than a spiderweb of what is talking to what. Why Decision Trails matter: Transparency is crucial in agentic systems. Users will trust an AI agent more if they can see why it took an action or what sequence of steps led to the outcome
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. By maintaining a persistent log, if something goes wrong or an outcome is unexpected, the user (or a support engineer) can review the trail to diagnose the issue. It also serves as a learning tool – users can understand how the agent works over time. Imagine a user looking back at last week’s project that their agent completed and seeing each step from posting to completion. This is analogous to an “audit log” or history in traditional apps, but focused on the AI’s autonomous decisions. From an implementation standpoint, ensure the log is stored persistently (in the DB) so that it’s not lost if the user refreshes or logs out. Show the most recent actions prominently (maybe the last few on the dashboard) and allow viewing the full history on a dedicated page or modal. Each entry should be timestamped and in human-readable terms. If technical details are useful (like an error message or an ID from a system), include them in a collapsible section or tooltip rather than the main text. Finally, be mindful of information overload: provide the essential details, but not every minor step the agent takes. A good strategy is progressive disclosure
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 – show high-level actions by default, and let the user expand or drill down into details if they want the nitty-gritty. For example, “Agent refined the project requirements based on chat input” could be high-level, and clicking it reveals the exact prompt or data snippet the agent added. This keeps the UI clean while still allowing full transparency on demand.
Notifications and Handling Long-Running Tasks
InstaBids agents might undertake tasks that span hours or even days – for example, monitoring a job posting until enough bids are collected, or waiting for a schedule confirmation. The frontend needs a notification system to keep users informed about these long-running processes, especially when the user is not actively watching the screen the moment something finishes. There are several layers to notifications:
In-app notifications: Provide a notification center or toast messages for events. For instance, if a new bid arrives or the agent completes a task in the background, show a toast popup like “🔔 New bid received from XYZ Contracting.” Shadcn UI doesn’t ship as a runtime library, but you can implement a notification/toast system using Radix UI primitives or any lightweight library, styled with Tailwind. These notifications should be brief and possibly offer an action (e.g., clicking the toast could navigate the user to the bids page or open a details modal). Use different icons or colors for different types (info, success, warning, etc.), maintaining consistency with standard feedback UX
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
.
Persistent notification tray: In addition to ephemeral toasts, have an icon (bell) in the header that opens a notifications panel. Here the user can see all recent important events. Each notification could include a timestamp and a short description (“Bid #123 from XYZ Contractors: $8,000”). This tray ensures that if the user was away, they can catch up on what happened.
Real-time delivery: To actually deliver these notifications, use web real-time technologies. One approach is using WebSockets or SSE from the backend. Given the A2A protocol’s support for server-sent events and even webhooks for task status changes
linkedin.com
, the backend could push updates to the frontend when key events occur. If using SSE, the Next.js app can establish an EventSource connection to a FastAPI endpoint that streams events. If using WebSockets, you might integrate a library like Socket.IO or just native websockets. However, since Supabase is in the mix, an alternative is to use Supabase Realtime: the backend can insert a row into a notifications table or update a task’s status in the DB, and the Supabase client listening on that can notify the UI. This avoids custom socket infrastructure by leveraging Postgres’s LISTEN/NOTIFY underneath Supabase’s realtime service.
Background/push notifications: For very long tasks (e.g., the agent will deliver results next day), consider notifications that reach the user even if they close the app. This could be done via email (Supabase can trigger emails via its Server-side functions or using external services), or via browser push notifications if the user opts in. A simple initial solution: send an email summary or alert once the process completes (“Your InstaBids agent has updates on your project!”). This falls a bit outside pure frontend scope but is part of the user experience planning.
Example scenario: A homeowner posts a project in the evening. Overnight, several contractors’ agents submit bids. The next morning, the user logs in – they should see a notification badge (e.g., “💬 3 new bids arrived while you were away”). Clicking it shows the list of bids or the timeline highlighting new events. Additionally, the user might have received an email or mobile push saying “3 new bids for your project ‘Kitchen Remodel’”. Another scenario: an agent might be performing a lengthy optimization or waiting on an external process (perhaps a permit approval). The UI could show a placeholder card in the interface: “Task in progress – we’ll notify you when there’s an update.” This sets expectation that the user can leave and come back later. When the task is done, a notification is triggered to draw the user back. This pattern is common in asynchronous systems (e.g., “Your export is ready for download” notifications in apps)
linkedin.com
. From a design perspective, make notifications unobtrusive but clear. They should not overwhelm the user with too many pop-ups (consider bundling related events), and allow the user to dismiss them. For long-running tasks, occasionally remind the user of progress. For instance, if something takes more than a few seconds, having a small status item in the UI like “Agent is still working (5 minutes elapsed)...” can be reassuring. Salesforce’s guide on asynchronous processing emphasizes giving feedback for long processes, possibly via polling with status updates or callbacks when done
linkedin.com
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. We want to avoid a situation where the user initiates an action and then is left wondering if it stalled. In summary, incorporate a multi-channel notification strategy: real-time toasts/in-app alerts for immediate feedback, a notifications panel for history, and external notifications (email/push) for truly long or offline events. This ensures users remain connected to the agent’s activities without needing to continuously monitor the app.
Integrating with the Backend (Supabase and MCP Tools)
Seamless integration between the frontend and InstaBids’ backend is essential. The backend comprises FastAPI endpoints for the various agents (HomeownerAgent, ContractorAgent, etc.) and likely uses Supabase (Postgres) for persistence. It also leverages Google’s A2A protocol and Anthropic’s MCP for agent interactions and tool use. The frontend’s job is to communicate with these services cleanly and efficiently. API Communication: The primary mode of integration will be RESTful API calls from Next.js to FastAPI. The InstaBids backend should expose endpoints for all major actions: e.g., POST /projects to create a new project, GET /projects/{id}/bids to list bids, POST /agents/homeowner/{id}/message to send a message to the homeowner’s agent, etc. Using Next.js’s fetch (or Axios) on the client side, you will call these endpoints. Ensure to include the authentication token (likely a Bearer JWT from Supabase Auth) in the headers of these requests
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 so that the backend can authorize the user and associate requests with the correct agent/user. It’s useful to wrap the fetch calls in a small client library or custom React hooks (e.g., a hook useBids(projectId) that calls the API and returns state including loading, data, error). This encapsulates the API details and makes it easier to handle loading spinners and errors consistently. For data fetching and caching, you might use SWR or React Query. These libraries can cache API responses and update them in the background, which is handy for something like a list of bids (it can auto-revalidate to fetch new bids periodically, although with real-time updates this might be secondary). SWR also works nicely with SSE streams. Streaming and real-time data: As touched on earlier, use SSE or websockets for any streaming endpoints. For example, if there’s an endpoint /agents/homeowner/{id}/chat_stream that streams the agent’s message, the frontend can open an EventSource and update state as messages arrive
linkedin.com
. The Vercel AI SDK’s useChat hook can handle a lot of this under the hood, but you’ll need to conform to how the backend streams data (likely text chunks or JSON events). Ensure the backend is set up for CORS and whatever protocol used so that the browser can connect to it. If the app is deployed on Vercel, FastAPI might be served as a serverless function or separate service; the streaming should still work as long as you flush responses properly on the server side
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Supabase integration: The frontend should also communicate with Supabase directly when appropriate. This includes using the Supabase JS client for operations like: signing in/out users, fetching user profile info, or reading application data that might be simpler to get via a direct DB query than via the FastAPI. For instance, if the list of bids is stored in a bids table, you have two options: (1) call FastAPI which queries the DB and returns JSON, or (2) query Supabase from the browser. Option (2) could be faster and reduce load on your FastAPI service for simple GETs. However, use direct Supabase queries judiciously – you don’t want to duplicate complex logic on the client. A good practice is to let the AI agents and backend handle the heavy logic (e.g., computing which contractors to notify, validating bid data) via APIs, and use Supabase client primarily for ancillary data that the frontend might need frequently or in real-time (like getting the latest status of a task or subscribing to a channel of events). Supabase’s real-time can effectively act as a substitute for custom webhooks: for example, when an agent writes an entry to agent_logs or a notifications table, the Supabase client can pick that up and you render it, instead of the backend having to push directly to the UI. MCP (Model Context Protocol) considerations: The backend’s use of MCP likely means that agents can use external tools or fetch context (e.g., accessing Supabase or other APIs) in a standardized way. From the frontend perspective, most of this is abstracted – you won’t call MCP endpoints directly; instead, you trigger agent actions and the backend handles MCP tool usage behind the scenes. However, it’s worth noting in the UI when an agent is doing a tool operation vs. conversing. For instance, if a contractor agent is using MCP to get data from a pricing API, there might be a slight delay or a specific event (“Agent is retrieving external data...”). If the backend can send back intermediate status (which MCP encourages, since it’s about tool integration), the frontend should display it. Essentially, be prepared to handle different types of responses from agents: not just text, but possibly structured data or file outputs (MCP can return JSON or file parts as Artifacts
linkedin.com
). The UI might then need to display a file link or render structured data nicely (like a table of comparison if the agent returns one). Design your data handling to check if a response is normal text vs. an artifact, and render accordingly. Error handling and retries: Integrating multiple systems (FastAPI, Supabase, AI models) means failures can happen at various points. The frontend should implement robust error handling strategies. For API calls, catch errors and display meaningful messages – e.g., “Failed to load bids. Please check your connection or try again later.” If a streaming connection drops, perhaps automatically attempt to reconnect (with exponential backoff) and inform the user (“Reconnecting to live updates…”)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. When an AI action fails (say the agent couldn’t complete a task), surface that: “⚠️ The InstaBids agent encountered an error while processing your request.” and provide a way to retry or get support
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. These messages should avoid technical jargon
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 but be specific enough (maybe include an error code if available for support). Align with general best practices: clarity, offering next steps (like a “Retry” button or contact support link)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Plan for edge cases like the backend being down – the UI should degrade gracefully (perhaps a banner “Service currently unavailable, please try again later” and disable certain actions)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Deployment considerations: If deploying on Vercel, note that you can host Next.js and a Python FastAPI on Vercel via serverless functions. Ensure the routing is configured correctly (e.g., through vercel.json) so that API calls are proxied to the FastAPI functions
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. In local development, you’ll run Next.js on, say, localhost:3000 and FastAPI on localhost:8000, so you might need to handle CORS and configure proxy for the dev server. Keep these in mind so integration is smooth in all environments. In short, the frontend will act as a orchestrator between the user and the multi-agent backend: calling REST endpoints for actions, listening to real-time channels for events, and updating the UI state accordingly. By using well-documented protocols (HTTP+JSON, SSE)
blog.wadan.co.jp

 and leveraging Supabase’s client features, we ensure a tight yet modular integration where each piece (frontend, FastAPI, database, agent system) can evolve independently without breaking the whole.
Intuitive UI Patterns for Multi-Agent Workflows
Wrapping a complex multi-agent workflow in an intuitive UI means presenting a simple, coherent experience to the user even though multiple AI agents (homeowner’s agent, matching agent, contractor agents, etc.) and possibly human inputs are interacting behind the scenes. The user should feel like they are interacting with one system – which acts like a competent assistant – rather than juggling multiple bots or processes. Here are design patterns and best practices to achieve that: 1. Primary Agent Interface: For each user role, designate a primary agent persona that the user interacts with. For a homeowner, this might be an “InstaBids Assistant” that helps them through the process of getting bids. For a contractor, it could be a “BidBot” that assists in finding projects and submitting proposals. All multi-agent coordination (like the MatchingAgent or BidCardAgent workings) can be abstracted behind this persona. In practice, this means the UI should mostly present one chat interface or one dashboard where the assistant handles everything – when it needs to delegate to another agent, it does so internally and then informs the user of the outcome. This follows the Supervisor Agent pattern, where a top-level agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. The user does not need to manually invoke each agent; they simply interact with the supervisor agent through the UI. 2. Contextual, Guided Interactions: Even though the system is agentic (autonomous), guiding the user with familiar UI patterns is still important. For instance, when posting a job, instead of making the user purely chat (“I want to hire a plumber”), you might present a guided form or wizard. This form can be dynamic – powered by the agent asking follow-up questions. A hybrid approach works well: start with a structured form (collect basic info), then transition to a conversational refinement (“Is there anything specific you want the contractors to know? [user answers]”). This ensures critical data is gathered and structured, while still allowing the flexibility of conversation for nuances. It also prevents the free-form nature of chat from becoming a barrier (some users prefer clicking options to typing). Use UI controls like dropdowns for known options, date pickers for scheduling, etc., in combination with open text for descriptions. The agent can suggest options too. For example, if the user says they need a job done “soon”, the agent could suggest dates or clarify via a quick-choice button (“Urgent (within 48h), This week, Flexible date”). Providing such UI affordances keeps the interaction user-friendly and steers the AI’s behavior with clearer inputs

. 3. Visualize Multi-Agent Processes Simply: If multiple agents are working, avoid exposing all complexity to the user, but do give an indication of parallel processes when relevant. For example, after a project is posted, the MatchingAgent might contact several ContractorAgents concurrently. The user doesn’t need to know agent names, but the UI can show a status like “Contacting available contractors…”. If you want to show progress: “5/10 contractors responded so far.” This implies multiple parties without listing each agent. However, if there is a user-facing distinction (like “AI Agent vs Human Contractor”), make that clear. Possibly use different avatars in the chat or different colors for messages that come from a human (contractor’s manual message) vs an automated agent message. In the future, if property managers have their own agent, and they collaborate with a homeowner’s agent, you might introduce UI cues like tags on messages (“From Homeowner’s Agent” vs “From Property Manager’s Agent”). But initially, try to keep one clear thread of communication for the end-user. 4. Leverage Familiar Metaphors: The multi-agent system can be conceptualized in the UI with metaphors like teamwork or assistant and specialists. For instance, the UI copy might say: “Your InstaBids assistant is working with a few specialists to get this done.” This sets the expectation that multiple “expertise” are involved (which is the truth of multiple agents) but in a friendly, human-relatable way. It’s analogous to telling a customer, “I have my colleagues looking into this.” We can even show profile-like cards for the agents (capabilities) in an “About” section – e.g., InstaBids Assistant: specializes in home project planning and coordinating contractors; Matching Agent: finds suitable contractors from our network, etc. – if we want to be transparent about the system’s workings. Google’s A2A introduces an Agent Card concept (JSON metadata describing an agent’s capabilities)
blog.wadan.co.jp
linkedin.com
. A user-facing adaptation could be a small info popup in the UI describing what the AI can do (and can’t). This helps set boundaries and expectations
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, making the system’s abilities less of a black box. For example, an Agent Card for the HomeownerAgent might say “🤖 Homeowner Assistant – I can help draft project requests, find matching contractors, and summarize bids. I cannot directly make payments or sign contracts for you (those steps are manual).” Presenting this at onboarding or in a “Help” section would educate users on the AI’s role. 

Figure: Example of a multi-agent workflow (travel booking use-case) with a supervisor agent coordinating specialized agents and tools. In InstaBids, a similar orchestration happens behind the scenes – e.g., a homeowner’s agent (like the “Supervisor Agent” in the figure) delegates tasks to a MatchingAgent or Bid Agents – but the UI abstracts this into a simple, unified experience for the user. The user interacts mainly with the supervisor agent (their “AI assistant”), while the assistant coordinates with other agents and tools to deliver results. By visualizing complex interactions internally (as on the diagram) but presenting a streamlined narrative externally, the UI can keep the user informed without overwhelming them with technical details. 5. Consistency and Predictability: As we introduce AI behaviors, it’s important to maintain UI consistency. Use a consistent layout for similar pages (dashboard for homeowner vs contractor might have different info but a similar structure so the app feels cohesive). Ensure that interactive elements behave in standard ways – e.g., links, buttons, forms – according to user expectations. Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics and the “8 Golden Rules” of interface design still apply
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. For instance, visibility of system status (we covered via status indicators), user control and freedom (allow users to cancel or undo agent actions)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, consistency and standards (use familiar icons and terms), error prevention and recovery (confirm risky actions, allow corrections)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, etc. One of the Golden Rules is also to reduce short-term memory load, which is relevant here: don’t force users to remember what the agent said two screens ago – keep context visible (like showing the project summary on the side as they review bids)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Another rule is to cater to both novice and expert users; in our case, some users might want to lean back and let the AI do everything (novice mode), while others might want to dig into details and manually tweak (expert mode). The UI can cater to this by providing sensible defaults (AI handles it) but also options for manual control or detailed views for those who want it
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. 6. Adaptive and Responsive Design: Since agents might operate across devices or channels (perhaps a future mobile app or SMS notifications), design the frontend to be responsive and adaptive. This means mobile-friendly layouts (Tailwind can help with utility classes for responsive design) and considering how the agent’s updates are shown on a small screen. Possibly use slightly different approaches on mobile (more condensed UI, more reliance on push notifications). The A2A protocol even discusses “UI capability detection” – agents adapting their output to the client’s display capabilities
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. For example, if on a mobile, the agent might send shorter messages or avoid large tables. While this is more on the agent’s side, the frontend can also nudge this by telling the agent (via an API param) what kind of UI it’s on. This is an advanced concept, but keeping it in mind ensures the design won’t be one-size-fits-all if the platform grows (think about voice interfaces or other modalities too in the future). In essence, design the UI as if the user is collaborating with a helpful human assistant that coordinates a team in the background. The user issues high-level requests, the assistant (UI) might ask a few follow-up questions (via forms or chat), then the assistant takes care of the rest, coming back with results and updates in a clear format. If the user needs to intervene or make a decision (like choosing among bids), the UI presents those choices clearly, with the AI’s recommendations perhaps highlighted but ultimately leaving control to the user. By following these patterns, the complexity of A2A multi-agent workflows is harnessed behind an intuitive, modern interface. The user experience becomes about accomplishing goals (get my project done) rather than managing algorithms or agents – the AI system becomes almost invisible, perceived more as a smart service embedded in the app.
UX Best Practices for LLM-Driven Agent Interfaces
Building a frontend for an AI-driven system requires careful attention to transparency, explainability, and user trust. Users may be unfamiliar with AI decision-making, so the UI must bridge that gap. Here are the best practices distilled for InstaBids:
Set Clear Expectations (Transparency): Make sure users know what the AI can and cannot do upfront
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This can be achieved by onboarding tips or a persistent help tooltip. For example, inform the user that the InstaBids agent can gather bids and suggest the best one, but the final choice is theirs and the agent might not have 100% of context (so they should review the recommendation). Clearly communicate when the agent is confident versus when it’s uncertain or needs input. An example message: “I’ve found a great contractor for you, but I want your approval before confirming the bid.” This kind of transparency helps users trust the agent’s intentions and limitations
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
.
Provide Explanations for Decisions: Whenever the agent makes a major recommendation or action, allow the user to understand why. As the Vivun UX team points out, users will ask “Why did it do that?”
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. The UI should be ready to answer. For instance, if the agent picks Contractor X as the winning bid, include a rationale: “Chosen because of highest rating and shortest timeline.” This could be shown as a small “Why?” link or info icon next to the recommendation, which when clicked, opens a popover or modal with a brief explanation. Use plain language in these explanations, not technical lingo
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. If the decision was data-driven, reference the data: e.g., “Contractor X’s quote was $500 below the average of other bids
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
.” If it was based on user preference, remind them (“We remembered you preferred contractors who have solar experience, which Contractor X has.”). By grounding the AI’s actions in understandable reasons, you demystify the AI and build trust.
Maintain User Control: The user should always feel in control of the process, with the AI as a support, not a loose cannon
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This means critical actions should require user confirmation. For example, the agent might draft a message awarding the job to a contractor, but the user must click “Confirm” to actually send it. Implement confirmations (dialogs) for things like committing to a bid, or spending money, etc.
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Also provide the ability to stop or undo actions where possible. If an agent is in the middle of a long task, a “Stop” button can send a cancel signal (and A2A tasks can indeed be canceled as per protocol
linkedin.com
). If a decision was made and it’s reversible, allow the user to rollback (e.g., “Undo bid acceptance” within a short time window, if the process allows). Furthermore, make it easy for users to correct the AI. If the agent misunderstood something (“No, I meant floor tiles, not wall tiles”), the UI should allow the user to provide that feedback immediately, perhaps via the chat interface or a quick edit button on the relevant data field. The agent can then recalibrate. This correction loop is vital – it turns mistakes into opportunities for the AI to learn user preferences
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
.
Feedback Mechanisms: Encourage users to give feedback on the agent’s performance. Simple thumbs up/down buttons on responses or outcomes can let the user indicate satisfaction
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. For example, after the agent suggests a bid, a thumbs-up means “this was helpful/good choice” and thumbs-down means “this isn’t right.” Accompany negative feedback with an option to provide a comment (“Tell us why it’s not a good choice”). This feedback can be fed back into improving the agent (either manually by developers or automatically if the agent retrains). It also signals to the user that their opinion matters and the AI isn’t an untouchable oracle. If certain agent actions are high-stakes, consider a quick satisfaction survey post-action (“Was this recommendation useful?”). However, be mindful to integrate feedback requests in a non-intrusive way; perhaps only after a significant interaction, not after every single agent message.
Error Transparency: When the agent can’t handle something, be honest about it. Instead of generic errors, the UI can show messages like “I’m sorry, I couldn’t find any contractors for that specialty.” or “Hmm, I had trouble understanding that request.” followed by suggestions (maybe rephrase, or contact support)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Users appreciate candidness – it sets the expectation that the AI isn’t infallible. If a particular feature is not yet available (“Scheduling is not automated yet”), communicate that so the user isn’t confused why the agent didn’t do it. Basically, never silently fail – always inform the user if the system hit a snag, and ideally provide a path forward (like “try again” or “we’ll notify you when this is resolved”)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
.
Consistency and UX Fundamentals: Even though this is an AI-centric app, it must still follow general UX best practices. Use consistent color coding (e.g., blue for informational messages, green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors) across all parts of the UI so users intuitively grasp the meaning of highlights or badges
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Keep typography and spacing clean and readable – Tailwind’s default styles and Shadcn’s components help maintain a modern look. Ensure interactive elements have proper affordances (e.g., buttons look clickable, links are underlined or clearly distinct). Follow accessibility guidelines: use proper ARIA labels for dynamic content, ensure contrast is sufficient, and support keyboard navigation. This is especially important as some AI UIs forget accessibility, but InstaBids should strive to be usable by all (Radix UI primitives will give you accessible scaffolding for modals, dialogs, etc., which you then style)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Remember that some users might prefer not to engage with the AI too much – the UI should also accommodate a more manual use if needed (for example, allow manually browsing contractor listings as a fallback).
Progressive Disclosure of AI Complexity: As mentioned, don’t overwhelm new users with all the bells and whistles of the AI. Start by showing primary actions and info, and hide the more complex logs or debug info under an “Advanced details” toggle or in a separate admin-only view
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Users should feel the system is straightforward at first glance (“I post a job, I get bids, I choose one”) and only later discover the rich agent logs or settings if they are interested. This keeps the learning curve gentle.
Trust through Design: Use the UI to build trust. This includes the language/tone – it should be friendly, professional, and not overly technical. The agent’s tone in chat should align with the brand (helpful, respectful, not too casual unless that’s the intended brand voice). Displaying some form of verification or success metrics can also help; for example, showing “InstaBids agents have successfully facilitated 1200 projects” somewhere can instill confidence. Another aspect is security and privacy cues: reassure users that their data is safe. If applicable, show a small lock icon or note “Your data is secure and used only to assist you (see privacy policy)”. Especially since AI systems can worry users (e.g., are they sharing my info publicly?), being transparent about data usage is good practice.
By following these UX best practices, the InstaBids frontend will not only be feature-rich but also user-friendly and trustworthy. Users will feel in control and informed, which is crucial for adoption of an AI-heavy platform. A mantra to keep in mind is: make the AI a team player. The UI should make the user feel that they and the AI agent are working together towards the user’s goals, each contributing what they do best – the user provides guidance and oversight, and the AI provides speed and expertise.
Starter Prompts and Code Scaffolding for Development
To accelerate the development of the InstaBids frontend, you can leverage AI coding assistants (like OpenAI’s Codex/Copilot, or Google’s upcoming Gemini, etc.) by feeding them well-crafted prompts. The key is to provide extensive context and clear instructions in those prompts so the AI generates code aligned with your needs
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. Here we outline how to prepare prompts and an initial project scaffold: Gather Required Context for the AI: Before prompting an AI to write code, assemble all relevant info about your project. This includes: the tech stack choices (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Supabase)
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, design guidelines (if you have a style guide or desired look and feel), API specifications for the backend
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
, and example data models (like what does a “Bid” object contain?). Also describe the functionality in plain terms – e.g., “Homeowner can create a project, view bids, and chat with agent; Contractor can view projects, submit bid; etc.” Basically, you are writing a mini-spec for each component or page that you want the AI to generate
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. The AI will only produce what it understands from the prompt, so including things like: “Use Tailwind classes for spacing as per our design (e.g., use p-4 for padding), use Shadcn UI button for actions, and follow accessible HTML practices” can guide its output style. Project Scaffold Setup: Start by creating a new Next.js project (e.g., npx create-next-app@latest instabids-web --typescript --eslint --src-dir). Install dependencies: tailwindcss (and init it), @supabase/supabase-js for the Supabase client, any state management if needed, and set up Shadcn UI by installing its CLI and adding a couple of example components (to ensure the configuration is right). For instance, run npx shadcn-ui@latest init to set up, then npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input toast for a few basic components. This will generate files in components/ui/ directory (like components/ui/button.tsx). Verify Tailwind is working (e.g., try a simple <div className="p-4 text-red-500">Test</div>). With the baseline ready, you can start using AI to flesh out parts of the app:
Generating UI Components with AI: Use prompts that describe the component in detail. For example, to generate a BidCard component, you might prompt the AI: “You are building a Next.js/React component for an InstaBids application. The component should be named BidCard and will display a summary of a contractor’s bid. Use the Shadcn UI Card component for layout. The component receives props: contractorName (string), price (number), status ('pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected'), and onSelect (function). Inside the card, display the contractorName, formatted price (e.g., $8,000), and a colored Badge indicating status (green for accepted, red for rejected, gray for pending). Include a Tailwind-styled button (using Shadcn button) that says 'View Details' and calls onSelect when clicked. Make sure to import components from '@/components/ui/card', '@/components/ui/badge', '@/components/ui/button'. Write the component in TypeScript and JSX.” This prompt includes structural details, design choices (color coding), and usage of our specific UI library
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. An AI given this should produce a React component following the description. Always specify the exact components and Tailwind classes you want, otherwise the AI might produce a generic or incorrect solution. If the output isn’t perfect, refine the prompt or edit the code manually – but this can save time by generating the boilerplate, prop definitions, etc., automatically.
Using AI for Pages and Hooks: You can similarly prompt the AI to create Next.js page components or API integration hooks. For instance: “Generate a Next.js page component for the Homeowner dashboard. It should fetch a list of projects from the backend (use a placeholder fetch from '/api/projects'). Use Next.js 13 App Router conventions with useEffect to fetch data on mount (or Next.js data fetching if applicable). Display each project title in a Card with a link to the project detail page. If data is loading, show a spinner. Use Tailwind for layout (flex, gap, etc.).” Along with this, provide the shape of the data if you know it (e.g., projects have id, title, status). The AI will output a functional component with the requested behavior. You might need to adjust it to your actual API and data, but it gives a starting structure.
Prompting for Backend Integration Code: If you have an OpenAPI spec or clear description of endpoints, you can have the AI write wrapper functions. For example: “Write a TypeScript function fetchActiveBids(projectId: string): Promise<Bid[]> that calls GET /api/projects/{projectId}/bids (returns JSON array of bids). Use fetch with the Supabase JWT token from local storage (or a passed-in auth token) in the Authorization header. Parse the JSON and return the result. Include error handling: if response not ok, throw an error with message.”
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
. This way, you get a ready-to-use API helper function. Similar prompts can be done for posting data (e.g., submitBid) or starting a streaming connection (the AI might give an example of using EventSource for SSE).
Scaffolding the File Structure: You may even prompt the AI to suggest a project structure. Often, a structure could be: components/ for reusable components, app/ for Next.js route segments (with folders like app/(homeowner)/dashboard/page.tsx), lib/ for utilities (like supabase client instantiation, API calls), etc. If unsure, ask the AI “Propose a file structure for a Next.js 13 project with separate sections for homeowner and contractor, using the App Router.” It might suggest something and you can adopt/adapt it. Popular templates or community examples (as cited in references
archive.leerob.io
cloudinary.com
) might also inform how to organize for multi-role.
AI in CSS and Tailwind: You can also use AI to generate complex Tailwind classes or styles if you provide a description or reference design. For example, “Create a Tailwind CSS class string for a card header that is blue with a subtle gradient and padding, used as a status banner.” But since Tailwind is utility-first, you’ll likely just compose classes yourself. Still, AI can help if you say “tailwind classes for a modal backdrop” etc.
Prompt Iteration: Often the first AI-generated code won’t be perfect. Treat it as a draft. Run it, see if it works, and refine. When refining, you can feed parts of the code back into the prompt to adjust. For instance, “The BidCard component you generated was great, but please add an icon next to the contractorName and make the price text larger and bold.” The AI can then modify its output accordingly. Always review the code for security and correctness. Don’t assume the AI used best practices unless you explicitly prompted for them (and even then, double-check). In particular, watch out for how the AI handles the Supabase client or secret keys – never paste your actual keys into the prompt; instead, use environment variables and instruct the AI accordingly. Full-stack Integration Testing: Once components and pages are scaffolded, integrate with the real backend. You might use dummy data to start, but as soon as the FastAPI endpoints are available, test the flows end-to-end. For streaming, ensure the AI’s approach to SSE or websockets aligns with the backend’s. If not, adjust either side. The Reddit discussion
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 and Vercel examples
file-5aajox55ts6uigpnhiwtvc
 can be references if issues arise. Example Prompt Recap: As a practical example, a full prompt for generating a Chat interface component might be: “Generate a React component using Next.js and Tailwind for an AI chat interface. It should display a list of messages and an input box. Use a Shadcn UI Card to contain the chat. Each message should be rendered inside a ScrollArea with different styling for user vs agent: user messages align right with a blue background, agent messages align left with a gray background. The component should have a state for messages (array of {sender: 'user'|'agent', text: string}). Map over this to render message bubbles (divs with styling). Also include a loading indicator at the bottom if isLoading state is true (e.g., 'Agent is typing...' in italics). The input box should allow the user to type a message and send it by pressing Enter or clicking a Shadcn Button. On send, call a prop function onSend(message: string) and clear the input. Make sure to style the input with Tailwind (e.g., borders, padding) or use Shadcn Input component. Ensure the ScrollArea scrolls to bottom when a new message is added.” This prompt instructs on structure, design, and integration points (prop for sending). The AI should produce a decent starting component following these instructions. By using such detailed prompts, the development team can quickly scaffold the core UI components and pages. However, keep in mind that human oversight is essential – AI can speed up writing boilerplate and even complex UI, but it might not fully capture the nuances of your application without guidance. Always run and test the generated code. Additionally, as you build more components, you’ll accumulate a design system (with your customized Shadcn components and Tailwind styles); you can then prompt the AI to follow the same style by referencing existing code (“use the same button style as in X component”). Lastly, maintain your code quality by running formatters (Prettier) and linters (ESLint) – you can even ask the AI to fix a piece of code to satisfy lint rules if needed. And as the project grows, periodically refactor the AI-generated code for consistency, since different prompts at different times might produce slightly varying patterns.
Following this comprehensive plan, the InstaBids frontend will be well-architected, user-friendly, and tightly integrated with its multi-agent backend. By combining the power of modern web frameworks with thoughtful UX design tailored for AI agents – and even using AI to build AI interfaces – InstaBids can deliver a cutting-edge experience where users seamlessly collaborate with AI to get their home projects done.
